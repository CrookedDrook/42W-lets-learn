        <br>
        <br> Ever heard of it? It's one of 17 megadiverse countries in the world, which means, it has lots of animals and plants. 
        It also was the first country in 2008 that recognized the rights of nature. 
        Rather than treating it like someone's property, nature has the constitutional 
        right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate it's vital cycles. Nice, huh?  
        <br>
        <br>
        He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Goethe Universität 
        in Frankfurt am Main in Music Studies (Musikwissenschaft) and Art 
        Education (Kunstpädagogik) as a minor.  <br>
        <br>
        Since then, he has worked on various projects in a wide range of fields, which have 
        taken him to Almaty, 
        Doha, Lima, Venice and Copenhagen, among other places.<br>
        <br> 
        In addition to his engagements as a musician and educator, he works in Berlin as a freelance consultant in the area of P2P fundraising, language tech and web development.<br>
        <br>
        On these days, he is busy deepening his HTML, CSS, JavaScript and UX/UI knowledge for upcoming projects.
